# ungulateSCR
This repository contains R code associated with "An evaluation of spatial capture-recapture models applied to ungulate non-invasive genetic sampling data" by P. Dupont, R. Bischof, C. Milleret, W. Peters, H. Edelhoff, C. Ebert, A. Klamm & U. Hohmann (submitted)

The script "Template_Simulations.R" contains R code to simulate a non-invasive genetic dataset of an ungulate-like population as well as NIMBLE code to fit a SCR model to the simulated data.
