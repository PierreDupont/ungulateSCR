# ungulateSCR
This repository contains R code associated with "An evaluation of spatial capture-recapture models applied to ungulate non-invasive genetic sampling data" by P. Dupont, R. Bischof, C. Milleret, W. Peters, H. Edelhoff, C. Ebert, A. Klamm & U. Hohmann (Journal of Wildlife Management, 2023).

The script "Template_Simulations.R" contains R code to simulate a non-invasive genetic dataset of an ungulate-like population based on species-specific characteristics (PARAM.SPACE folder), NIMBLE code to fit a SCR model to the simulated data, and R code to load and plot results from the simulation study ("results.RData").
